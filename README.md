I am a 27 year old Memphis Native. I am an aspiring software developer, looking to build my skills in programming languages and strengthen my knowledge around the coding world.

My tech interest peaks from being a 3 year old playing on Windows 98 and it grew from there. Learning the ins-and-outs of what a computer does only made me want gain more knowledge about the tech world.

## Things I'm Interested In When It Comes to Software Engineering:

    <li>UX Design</li>
    <li>Application Security</li>
    <li>Full Stack</li>
    <li>DevOps</li>
